# DSL_music üé∂ + üíª

This is a school project (from the subject "Implementation of Computational Methods"). This is basically a parser for a domain specific language (DSL), the
DSL is to create through the language the music you can imagine.

## About this project? üîç

First of all, what is a DSL? A Domain Specific Language is basically a programming language for solving problems in a specific area, in this project, for music creation.
At least in this field, there are many DSLs with the same purpose, ie: Mutran, Mut, M (in fact, to make this project I relied on the Mut Lexicon and Grammar).


## What exactly does the code do? üéØ

Basically, the code is a basic compiler that allows us to create music (through code) with the DSL language.
The process is divided into four stages.
1. Read a file (with the exception of ".txt") containing the script
2. The program parses the lexemes in the script using ***Regex***
3. If there was no error, we start the syntax analysis, using the ***recursive descence***. 
4. And if everything is ok, then the program reproduce the music that you put in the file

If you want to know more technical aspects, you can read the [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QFJCF8eRVqfNWzTA_WRxsCGYkeSiAfOa/view?usp=sharing) üìÉ I wrote, 
where I described in more detail the functionality of each step and the logic of the solution.

Also, in that file you can see the grammar diagrams (for the grammar parser), the finite automaton diagram (for the lexical analyzer, the automaton was not programmed 
but was very useful for understand the lexems and through that create the regex expresions) and a video where explain the code and make video that explains the code 
and I test the code.

## How to use it?

It is easy to use, run the file *"evidencia1.py"*, the program will run, first it will ask you for the file to play, give it a name (with or without the ".txt" extension), *take care that the file must be in the same folder as the script, otherwise the program will never find the file you are trying to play.*

Once the program reads the file, it will start the lexical analysis and before the grammar analysis, if the program finds an error in your "code", it will warn you and tell you which line the error is on. üí¨

If all is well, the program will play the song you encoded. üéµ

## Limitations üí¢

Program limitations
The code works, if you give the parser an input, if there is an error and if not, it plays the music you wrote in the file, the problem is thatthe program can 
only play one instrument (or voice) in time (that means that the program ***cannot play music in parallel***).

The second limitation is that the lexemes I use limit the possible musical creations (that's because it's a very simple compiler, with a ***short lexicon***).
